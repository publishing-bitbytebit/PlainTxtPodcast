# Coming to `term{ ][s][ination]`    

means looking at your plot of land and reeping what you `s{ow][we`  
the zeniths and valleys are `vital{ ][s`  
beeping,  
repeating,  
beeping,  
repeating  
—like a restitched line  
`re{visting][membering]` where we were when learning **AND** lost  
—feelings we must come to terms with.   
  
and as one chapter comes to term  
each new page returns to its `close{ ][d` past    
giving context of the chapters to come but lasting presently  
You're a book in hand— `(dis)regarded` by  certain medium-makers for your presence currently.  
To exist in this reality is the shifting weight of layered pages in winter-chapped hands,  
This affects me...  
like I mean physically, or maybe the word is viscerally, but also emotionally!   
Have you detached this feeling of existence thats weighing heavily down on me  
—wondering can't you see?  
  
Modes to monitor are at every single finger tip:   
typing,   
taping,  
timing,  
tracking  
—the existence of this entire world   
—a record with every click  
—waiting on a report that's waiting to be written.  
  
_IF_ (learning and `be][do{ing` are two in the same) {then we need to reflect and connect.  
every dot is really a loop    
and we just need the patterns  
so we can _OUT_ the  algorithms.}  
_ELSE_ (null) {what are we really `learn][do][be{ing`?}  
  
certainly not human   
... being ...  
It's too `mechanic][tradition{al`—  
now doesnt that sound `oxymoronic-al`   
Let's seek (our) potential  
`socie][communi{ty`...   
ME. Are there patterns to read in  
  
a chapter, page, paragraph, sentence,a WORD?   
each a chosen `catergory|hierarchy` 
ingesting a text whether counting words or comparing books
is another step closer ...  
'casue if we can amass and contrast the writing from our pasts   
Who cares if the results don't pass your scrutiny.  
There is power in the act of assemble.   
In knowing all the little parts that need accounted for  
—without reading|hearing|seeing every piece 
we begin to see entirity differntly.

Hello everyone out there in cyberspace. We're together today at last for the very first episode of the plain.txt podcast. Welcome.  
I'm coming to you at a time in my life where I am just having to come to terms with things. Do you know the feeling?
