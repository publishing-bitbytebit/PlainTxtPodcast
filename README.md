[![original design for podcast's website banner; On the far-left is a roughly sketched notepad with "d.h." scribbled on the front. The notepad is propped up with its slightly open pages acting as a stand and the coiled, wire-binding at the top. The text "plain.txt podcast" sits to the right of the notepad taking up the remaining 3/4 of the image.](https://github.com/publishing-bitbytebit/PlainTxtPodcast/blob/wip/images/dhNotepadWithText.png "plain.txt podcast DH notepad logo")](http://plaintxtpodcast.com/)  

> **Image Caption:** _Our website's banner, seen in the above image, primarily features our logo (a roughly, sketched spiral-notepad with "d.h." scribbled on the front). This logo was created by [Tyler Monaghan - @tymonaghan](https://github.com/tymonaghan) in early 2018. After Tyler contributed the logo to our team's shared Google Drive, [Taylor Brown - @taylorcate](https://github.com/taylorcate) created the image above by adding the "plain.txt podcast" text to the right of the notepad. You might notice the "plain.txt podcast" text of the above image differs slightly from our website banner's actual text. When developing the website [Griffin Moe - @gmoe](https://github.com/gmoe) and [Rebecca Parker - @RJP43](https://github.com/RJP43) spent a considerable amount of time reviewing a variety of possible fonts. Primarily influenced by Griffin's design experience and a mutual appeal for a certain aesthetic, the team decided on using font [`Noto Serif SC`:link:](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif+SC) for the headings on the podcast's website including the banner. In addition to the font change, unlike the above image, the website's banner features a larger font size and a shift from two lines ("plain.txt" over "podcast") to a single line of text. These decisions were made during site development based on the above-mentioned website developers' mutual appeal for a bold but plain aesthetic._
