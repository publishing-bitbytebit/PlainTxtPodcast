[Zach](https://twitter.com/zstella48) - [@zmstell](https://github.com/zmstell): Alright, hello everyone in cyberspace, I’m Zach Stella and today I am here with my co-host Rebecca Parker.  
  
[Becca](https://twitter.com/bcpkr396) - [@RJP43](https://github.com/RJP43): Doing great, thanks Zach! And welcome every body to the very first episode of the plain.txt podcast - this is an entirely student-led initiative aimed to discover, de-stigmatize, and debate Digital Humanities topics. This podcast is produced by [Loyola University Chicago](https://www.luc.edu/) Digital Humanities Master’s Students and friends. We are proudly supported by [Loyola's Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities](https://www.luc.edu/ctsdh/).
  
Becca: Today we will be addressing our field's question of the century: What is Digital Humanities? We sat down with Loyola's CTSDH Directors, [Dr. Elizabeth Hopwood](https://twitter.com/LizzieHopwood) and [Dr. Kyle Roberts](https://twitter.com/kylebroberts) to ask them for their go-to DH definitions. Zach and I then gathered fellow Digital Humanities students [Taylor Brown](https://twitter.com/AdventScholar)-[@taylorcate](https://github.com/taylorcate) and [Tyler Monaghan](https://twitter.com/TyMonaghan)-[@tymonaghan](https://github.com/tymonaghan) along with our Loyola Chicago affiliated friends [June Coyne](https://twitter.com/junipercoyne)-[@jcoyne](https://github.com/jcoyne47), a History PhD, and Software Engineering Alum [Griffin Moe](https://twitter.com/griffin_moe)-[@gmoe](https://github.com/gmoe) to reflect on Hopwood's and Robert's responses. We'll jump right into our [#debatingDH](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DebatingDH?src=hashtag_click) session after hearing from Hopwood and Roberts - so let's take a listen to what they had to say when asked "What is Digital Humanities?"
